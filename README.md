# sentiment-analyzer-using-NLP
This project is based upon Natural Language Processing. The main objective of the project is to predict/determine the sentiment behind the movie review by critics. Using the output generated by our algorithm as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE, we can determine the manner in which the movie in consideration was perceived by the people in general. This project can be used by the Directors and Producers of movies/series so as to get feedback on their production. This project hasn't been deployed publicly but has been hosted on Github.
